# Resume
Repository for my general resume written in Latex. 

## Prerequisites
Simply download or view the pdf file to view the contents of the resume. If you wish to use this as a template please downlaod the .cls and .tex files to your machine. Building your own pdf file will require installing a distribution of [Tex](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) and some kind of Tex editor, I used [TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/). Or you can use a web based version such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
