# Resume
Repository for my general resume written in Latex. 

## Prerequisites
Simply download or open the pdf file to view the contents of the resume. If you wish to use this as a template please downlaod the .cls and .tex files to your machine. Building your own pdf file will require installing a distribution of [Tex](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) and some kind of Tex editor. I have used [TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) in the past and now use VS Code with the Latex Workshop extension. Alternatively you can use a web based version such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

### Acknowledgement
Although I am the author of this repository and its contents I had many resources during its development. Unfortuantely I have since lost the links to the original files where I took inspiration from. I will do my best to update this file in the future if the original authors can be found to give credit where credit is due.
